                <p>Plantains are a staple food of the Dominican Republic. Mashed plantains or "Mangu" is a favorite dish typically eaten for breakfast but can really be eaten at any part of the day. It is usually served with at least one of the 3 "Golpes" or hits (fried cheese, salami, or fried egg) or all 3.

        <h4>Directions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li> 
                    Peel the plantains (see how-to) and cut lengthwise, then divide each half into two.You can remove the center where the seeds are located (optional, this is just my preference for a smoother mangú). 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Boil the plantains in enough water to cover them plus an inch until they are very tender, having added the salt to the water before the water breaks the boil.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove the plantains from the water and mash them right away with a fork until they are very smooth and there are few to no lumps (be careful not to burn yourself).
                    Mix in butter, and progressively add a cup of water at room temperature and keep mashing and mixing until it turns into a very smooth puree (see tips below).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet over low heat. Add onions and cook and stir until they become translucent. Pour in vinegar and season with salt to taste.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Garnish mangu with the onions and serve per suggestions above.
                </li>
            </ol>
